    <p>
        
        As the Designer for the site we have been working on two tasks for the design of the site that we are going to make:
        
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Overall Structure</li>
        <li>Proposal for Search Function</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Overall Structure</h2>
    <p>Starting with the Overall Structure of the site it will have to be an eye catching colour that draws the user in so using bright colours that work well with the page will be fine to use. Also, using font colours like black, grey and other dark colours will make it easier for people to see if they have vision problems.
    To make the site user friendly it would be good to make sure that the user can navigate around the site easilly so using the same layout on each page with buttons and a logo page so that they can easilly navigate through the site without fault.</p>
    <p>Another piece of structure for the site would be being able to increase the size of the text which again allows users with vision problems be able to see the page better by clicking a certain button which allows the text to increase in size.</p>
    <p>Lastly, with Navigating the site there will be over 4 pages which are very user friendly as there will be buttons labled to allow the user to click and it shall take them to wherever they want on the site.</p>
    <h2>Proposal for Search Function</h2>
    <p>On the site there will be a search function which will allow users to search keywords which allows them to navigate around and give them results from what they have searched in. Sites like google.com do this which allows users to search in a question, a website, anything they want pretty much and it will come up with results with a click of a button. With the design of the site it will allow the users to search whatever they want and it will be user friendly so that they dont need to learn how to use the site as they can easilly navigate it as soon as they enter it.</p>
